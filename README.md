# parser_test
My personal fun project.  
Please note that it relies on many dependencies.  
Warning: This is my fun project and there is no warranty of any kind.  
I recommend kphp as an alternative to this project.

##
- [ ] class
- [ ] STDIN

And many functions are not supported.

## 
- [x] print
- [x] echo
- [x] if
- [x] else
- [x] elseif
- [x] for
- [x] while
- [x] (+,-,*,/)
- [x] true,false

And it contains many unknown bugs.
